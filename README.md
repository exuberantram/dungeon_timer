# Rammy's Dungeon Timer
## This timer is a way to track how long your players spend moving, fighting, and exploring in a dungeon. 
### I was mostly tired of using OneNote to try my best to keep track of this while DMing a Dungeon of the Mad Mage campaign. 
### This is an excellent exercise for me to learn more about variables in JS and bringing it back to HTML

## So Far, the plan is:
- Make the layout: left is instructions, right is buttons to ease of adding, and the center displays total time
- Add button functionality
- Add a reset button to wipe the variables from the counter

## Nice-To-Haves:
- Save functionality for breaks in-between sessions
- Add functionality to save previous times (Helps keep track of how long it takes to navigate areas commonly returned to)
- Make the time references on the left clickable
- Add a pop-up to the reset button to confirm
- Ability to add custom times
